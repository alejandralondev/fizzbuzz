        <h1>FIZZBUZZ!</h1>
		<p>Write a program that shows all numbers between 1 and 100 with the following exceptions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>It shows "Fizz" instead if the number is divisible by 3.</li>
			<li>It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is divisible by 5 and not by 3.</li>
			<li>When it's done, improve it so that the program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers divisible both by 3 and by 5.</li>
		</ol>
